I am an MPhil Candidate at Urban Governance and Design Thrust, Society Hub, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), and an exchange student at the Division of Social Science, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

My research uses quantitative methods to examine inequality between societal changes and individual decisions through life courses combined with interdisciplinary perspectives from sociology, demography, and economics, focusing on China. I am also a time-use researcher using time-use diary data such as the Multinational Time Use Study (MTUS) and China Time Use Survey (CTUS).
